## Overview

This course will provide the students with a solid understanding of the state of the art and the key conceptual and practical aspects of the design, implementation and evaluation of intelligent machines and autonomous systems that learn by interacting with their environment. The course also takes into consideration ethical, societal and philosophical aspects related to these technologies.

Strong focus on the state-of-the-art (and whatâ€™s next): read papers from leading AI/ML conferences (but also classics from the ML field), try software, etc.
