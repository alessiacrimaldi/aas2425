    "text": "1.1 Computing Machinery and Intelligence\nWhat is intelligence? Can we build intelligence into a machine?\nThis idea of thinking and of being an intelligence agent is thoroughly examined by Alan Turing in his paper, published in the Mind philosophy journal, which talks about how to build these machines. His very old and interesting paper is about the Turing Test, originally called the Imitation Game, which consists in testing if a machine can actually think and reason like a human:\n– I propose to consider the question, “Can machines think?” This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms “machine” and “think”. –\nIn proposing his question-answer test Turing (1950) introduced the idea through a Gender Imitation Game The experiment involves a computer and a human pretending to be the opposite gender.\nIn this game a human interrogator of either sex simultaneously questions two hidden interlocutors: one man and one woman. The purpose of the man is to pretend to be a woman; the woman’s task is to tell the truth. The interrogator must determine the actual woman. Replacing one of the hidden interlocutors with a machine Turing asked:\n“May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does?”\nTuring quite rightly raised that question realising after WWII that man does not think like every other man; man does think like woman; an Occidental woman may not think like a woman from the Orient.\nGender is regarded as an important feature in Turing’s game by some (Copeland & Proudfoot 2008; Sterrett, 2000; Lassègue, 1996; Hayes & Ford, 1995; Genova, 1994). The contention is that both man and machine impersonating a woman provides a stronger test for intelligence. However, neither of these researchers have explained what they mean by gender nor have they provided empirical evidence to substantiate their claim.1",

It then takes actions and learns from experience to improve its performance.\nOne approach to achieving this involves trial and error learning : driving –initially in a purely random way– while receiving feedback from a human driver, enabling the system to gradually refine its behavior.

    "text": "1.3 AI Systems Mastering Games with Reinforcement Learning\nAs previously discussed, this module explores AI systems that interact with and operate within their environments. Without relying on logic rules, these systems learn —whether how to drive a car, how to play video games or how to walk— from the observations, the states, so from what they observe (e.g. pixels, images, etc.). These algorithms are driven purely by reinforcement learning, without any human data, guidance or domain knowledge.\n\nInput: the pixels and the reward (e.g. game score).\nGoal: learn how to drive/play/walk from scratch, with no prior knowledge.\n\nThe systems learn through trial and error, balancing exploration and exploitation to refine their behaviour over time.\n\nMs. Pac-Man\n\nFor example, in Ms. Pac-Man, we wouldn’t know which character is a ghost, which one is Miss Pac-Man, or where the cherry is. Instead, we learn everything simply by analyzing the pixels on the screen.\n\n\n\n\nAtari 2600 games\n\nAtari games were solved with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) using a method called Deep Q-Network (DQN), which was introduced by researchers at DeepMind in 2013 (and a more detailed version of the research was later published in the Nature journal in 2015). This approach revolutionized the way AI systems could learn to play video games.\n\n  210 \\(\\times\\) 160 pixel image frames with 128 colours at 60Hz.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rFwQDDbYTm4?si=ozHD2X8AwNt398xw\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game of Go\n\nThe game of Go was solved in 2016 using Deep Reinforcement Learning as well, but in a more sophisticated manner compared to Atari games. This was achieved by DeepMind’s AlphaGo and its subsequent versions (AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero), which used a combination of Deep Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning techniques to master the game.\n\n  \\(19 \\times 19\\)\n\n\n  Configurations of Go.\n\nThe AlphaGo paper is particularly intriguing because Go is an exceptionally complex game. Played on a \\(19 \\times 19\\) board, where each tile can be empty, white, or black, the total number of possible valid configurations —possible states— is approximately \\(10^{170}\\), excluding impossible ones. And given that the number of atoms in the observable universe is \\(10^{80}\\), this highlights the immense complexity of that game: there are more configurations of Go than atoms in the universe.\nIn AlphaGo, the model was pretrained using experience from previous games.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, AlphaGo Zero learned to play Go entirely from scratch (“tabula rasa”“), without any prior knowledge of the game —similar to how it approached Atari games. Despite this, it quickly achieved superhuman performance, discovering solutions and completely novel ways of playing never saw before.\n\n\n\n\nStarCraft\n\nIn 2020, DeepMind achieved a major AI breakthrough by mastering StarCraft using only pixel-based input. This is an especially complex game, as it requires strategic planning and coordination between multiple agents within the system. AlphaStar, DeepMind’s AI, went on to compete against top human players, winning high-level competitions and demonstrating superhuman performance.\n\n  https://youtu.be/6EQAsrfUIyo?si=gUXbT-NVSvlvSco6\n\n\nPoker\n\nAI has made significant breakthroughs also in poker, a game that is particularly challenging for machines due to its incomplete information, meaning players don’t have full knowledge of the game state (unlike chess or Go).\nDeepStack was a groundbreaking AI developed by the University of Alberta, Charles University, and Czech Technical University. It was the first AI to beat professional human players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em.\n\n  https://youtu.be/SI-i-fQBv1Y?si=17Mh4EWnD5ofqdFN",

    "text": "1.4 Real-World Applications of Agentic Systems\nReinforcement learning algorithms can be described as decision-making algorithms or agentic systems, as they are designed to autonomously make decisions and take actions based on their environment. Let’s see some real-world applications of them.\n\n🦿 Robotics: Learning how to walk\n\nOne of the most fascinating applications of reinforcement learning in robotics is enabling machines to walk autonomously. Instead of being programmed with predefined motion rules, these AI-driven systems learn purely from experience. By receiving only sensor readings —such as joint positions and balance data— the robot explores and refines its movements through trial and error.\nA great example of this can be seen in DeepMind’s research, where an AI-controlled robot learns to walk from scratch. With no prior knowledge of physics or locomotion, the system gradually discovers stable and efficient ways to move, adapting dynamically to different terrains.\n\n  https://youtu.be/gn4nRCC9TwQ?si=Sw2HOFkXfOHQf4Qc\n\n\n⚡️ Cloud Farms: Optimizing Energy and Load Distribution\n\n\n\n\nAgentic systems are widely used in cloud farms to optimize resource management. Through reinforcement learning, these systems can learn how to minimize energy consumption and efficiently distribute workloads across different processors.\nThe idea is to enable the system to continuously adapt and make decisions in real time, balancing energy efficiency and performance. By learning from the environment and adjusting its actions accordingly, the system can find the optimal distribution of tasks while reducing power usage, thus improving both operational efficiency and sustainability.\n\n      Source: https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/safety-first-ai-for-autonomous-data-centre-cooling-and-industrial-control/\n\n\n💨 Wind Turbines: Boosting the Value of Wind Energy\n\n\n\n\nReinforcement learning is also used to optimize the orientation of wind turbines, ensuring they adjust dynamically to maximize energy production. By continuously learning from wind patterns and environmental conditions, RL algorithms enhance forecastic accuracy, improving both efficiency and sustainability.\n\n  Source: https://deepmind.com/blog/article/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy\n\n\n🔋 Android: Enhancing Battery Life and Display Performance\n\n\n\n\nModern smartphones rely on AI to optimize user experience, and reinforcement learning plays a key role in making Android devices smarter and more efficient. By continuously adapting to user behavior, reinforcement learning helps improving power management and display settings, leading to better performance and energy savings:\n\nAdaptive battery: used to learn and anticipate future battery use.\nAdaptive brightness of the video: algorithm learns preferences in terms of brightness from the user.\n\nThese AI-driven optimizations enhance battery life and display performance, providing a seamless and energy-efficient user experience.\n\n💬 LLMs: Reinforcement Learning for Generative AI\n\nReinforcement learning is at the core of many groundbreaking AI advancements, driving a multi-trillion-dollar revolution. Actually, besides robotics and game-playing AI, reinforcement learning plays a key role in training large language models (LLMs).\nTherefore, we’re entering this Brand New Wold 2 of agents that are based on foundational models and this is really changing everything (referring to the launch of Chat-GPT in 2022). Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence (i.e. general purpose AI) refers to the early signs that artificial intelligence is reaching human-like capabilities (or even more), such as general reasoning, autonomous learning (making decisions), and adaptability to different tasks. This expression became popular after the Microsoft Research paper titled “Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4”, in which researchers suggested that GPT-4 exhibits some characteristics that could be considered precursors to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). However, the model is not yet a true AGI but rather a step in that direction.\n\n\n\nThe Brave New World\n\n\n\n\nThese foundational LLMs are trained using reinforcement learning in various ways. One key approach is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):\n\n\n\nIt involves human preferences, where either humans or machine-generated feedback (known as distillation, such as DeepSeek using GPT-4) helps optimize outputs. A common method for this is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which fine-tunes models based on ranked feedback.\n\n\nEven more effectively, instead of relying on direct human feedback for every interaction, we can build a model of preferences —trained on responses from a large number of people— to encapsulate human preferences and guide model training more efficiently.\n\n\n\nGeneral picture",

The process starts by creating an environment and retrieving the initial state. The agent then enters a loop where it selects an action based on the current state in each iteration. After executing the action, the environment provides feedback in the form of a new state and a reward. Finally, the agent updates its knowledge based on the state, action, and reward it received.\n\nenv = create_environment()\nstate = env_get_initial_state()\n\nfor i in range(n_iterations):\n    action = choose_action(state)\n    state, reward = env_execute(action)\n    update_knowledge(state, action, reward)",

    "section": "2.3 Goals and Rewards",
    "text": "2.3 Goals and Rewards\n\nThe goal of the agent is formalised in terms of the reward it receives.\nAt each time step, the reward is a simple number \\(R_t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\nInformally, the agent’s goal is to maximise the total amount it receives.\nThe agent should not maximise the immediate reward, but the cumulative reward.\n\n\nThe Reward Hypothesis\n\nWe can formalise the goal of an agent by stating the “reward hypothesis”:\n\nAll of what we mean by goals and purposes can be well thought of as the maximisation of the exprected value of the cumulative sum of a received scalar signal (reward).\n\n\nExpected Returns\n\nIn RL, actions carry long-term consequences, impacting both immediate and future rewards. The agent’s goal goes beyond maximizing immediate gains; it receives a sequence of rewards and it strives to accumulate the highest total reward over time. This leads us to a key concept in RL: the expected return.\n\nThe expected return \\(G_t\\) is a function of the reward sequence \\(R_{t+1}, R_{t+2}, R_{t+3}, \\dots\\)\n\n\\(G_t\\) is the sum of all rewards the agent expects to accumulate throughout its journey.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccordingly, the agent learns to anticipate the sequence of actions that will yield the highest possible return.\n\nEpisodic Tasks and Continuing Tasks\n\nIn RL, we encounter two types of tasks: episodic and continuous.\nEpisodic tasks are those in which we can identify a final step of the sequence of rewards, i.e. in which the interaction between the agent and the environment can be broken into sub-sequences that we call episodes (such as play of a game, rpeeated tasks, etc.). For example, in a chess game played by an agent, each game constitutes an episode; once a game concludes, the environment resets for the next one.\n\nAn episodic task is divided into distinct episodes, each with a defined beginning and end.\n\nEach episode ends in terminal state after \\(T\\) steps, followed by a reset to a standard starting state or to a sample of a distribution of starting states.\n\n\nThe next episode is completely independent from the previous one.\n\n\nOn the other hand, continuing tasks involve ongoing interaction without distinct episodes (e.g. ongoing process control or robots with a long-lifespan). A typical example is an agent continuously adjusting traffic lights in a city to optimize flow.\n\nA continuing task is one in which it is not possible to identify a final state.\n\n\nExpected Return for Episodic Tasks and Continuing Tasks\n\n\nIn the case of episodic tasks the expected return associated to the selection of an action \\(A_t\\) is the sum of rewards defined as follows:\n\n\\(G_t \\doteq R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + R_{t+3} + \\dots + R_T\\)\n\n\n\nIn the case of continuing tasks the expected return associated to the selection of an action \\(A_t\\) is defined as follows:\n\n\\(G_t \\doteq R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\dots  = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}\\)\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the discount rate, with \\(0 \\leq \\gamma \\leq 1\\).\n\n\nDiscounting Rewards\n\nImmediate rewards are typically valued more than future ones, leading to the concept of discounted return. This concept prioritizes more recent rewards by multiplying each reward by a discount factor, gamma, raised to the power of its respective time step. For example, for expected rewards r1 through rn, the discounted return would be calculated as r1 + gamma * r2 + gamma^2 * r3, and so on.\n\n\n\nThe discount factor \\(\\gamma\\), ranging between 0 and 1, is crucial for balancing immediate and long-term rewards. A lower gamma value leads the agent to prioritize immediate gains, while a higher value emphasizes long-term benefits. At the extremes, a gamma of zero means the agent focuses solely on immediate rewards, while a gamma of one considers future rewards as equally important, applying no discount.\n\n\n\n\nNumerical example:\n\nIn this example, we’ll demonstrate how to calculate the discounted_return from an array of expected_rewards. We define a discount_factor of 0.9, then create an array of discounts, where each element corresponds to the discount factor raised to the power of the reward’s position in the sequence.\n\nimport numpy as np\nexpected_rewards = np.array([1, 6, 3])\ndiscount_factor = 0.9\ndiscounts = np.array([discount_factor ** i for i in range(len(expected_rewards))])\nprint(f\"Discounts: {discounts}\")\n\nDiscounts: [1.   0.9  0.81]\n\n\nAs we can see, discounts decrease over time, giving less importance to future rewards. Next, we multiply each reward by its corresponding discount and sum the results to compute the discounted_return, which is 8.83 in this example.\n\ndiscounted_return = np.sum(expected_rewards * discounts)\nprint(f\"The discounted return is {discounted_return}\")\n\nThe discounted return is 8.83\n\n\n\nRelation between Returns at Successive Time Steps\n\n\nReturns at successive time steps are related to each others as follows:\n\n\\(G_t \\doteq R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\gamma^3 R_{t+4} + \\dots\\) \\(\\quad\\;\\; = R_{t+1} + \\gamma (R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+3} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+4} + \\dots )\\) \\(\\quad\\;\\; = R_{t+1} + \\gamma G_{t+1}\\)",

    "text": "2.8 Difference between RL and other ML sub-domains\nRL differs significantly from other types of machine learning, such as supervised and unsupervised learning.\nIn supervised learning, models are trained using labeled data, learning to predict outcomes based on examples. It is suitable for solving problems like classification and regression.\nUnsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves learning to identify patterns or structures from unlabeled data. It is suitable for solving problems like clustering or association analysis.\nReinforcement Learning, distinct from both, does not use any training data, and learns through trial and error to perform actions that maximize the reward, making it ideal for decision-making tasks.\n\n\n\n\nRL vs. Supervised Learning\n\nSupervised learning is learning from a set of labeled examples and, in interactive problems, it is hard to obtain labels in the first place. Therefore, in “unknown” situations, agents have to learn from their experience. In these situations Reinforcement learning is most beneficial.\n\nRL vs. Unsupervised Learning\n\nUnsupervised learning is learning from datasets containing unlabelled data. Since RL does not rely on examples (labels) of correct behaviour and instead explored and learns it, we may think that RL is a type of unsupervised learning. However, this is not the case because in Reinforcement Learning the goal is to maximise a reward signal instead of trying to find a hidden structure.\nFor this reason, Reinforcement Learning is usually considred a third paradigm in addition to supervised and unsupervised learning.",

In this setting, the agent learns through rewards and penalties. These guide it towards developing more effective strategies without any kind of direct supervision.\n\nSequential decision-making\n\nDecisions influence future observations\n\nLearning through rewards and penalties\n\nNo direct supervision\n\n\n\nAppropriate vs. Inappropriate for RL\n\nAn appropriate example for RL is playing video games, where the player needs to make sequential decisions such as jumping over obstacles or avoiding enemies. The player learns and improves by trial and error, receiving points for successful actions and losing lives for mistakes. The goal is to maximize the score by learning the best strategies to overcome the game’s challenges.\n\n\nPlayer makes sequential decisions.\nReceives points and loses lives depending on actions.\n\nConversely, RL is unsuitable for tasks such as in-game object recognition, where the objective is to identify and classify elements like characters or items in a video frame. This task does not involve sequential decision-making or interaction with an environment. Instead, supervised learning, which employs labeled data to train models in recognizing and categorizing objects, proves more effective for this purpose.\n\n\nNo sequential decision-making.\nNo interaction with an environment.",

    "text": "3.1 K-armed Bandit Problem\nConsider the following learning problem. We are faced repeatedly with a choice among \\(k\\) different options, or actions. After each choice we receive a numerical reward chosen from a stationary probability distribution that depends on the action we selected. Our objective is to maximise the expected total reward over some time period, for example, over 1000 action selections, or time steps. This is the “classic” k-armed bandit problem, which is named by analogy to a slot machine or “one-armed bandit”, except that it has \\(k\\) levers instead than one. Each action selection is like a play of one of the slot machine’s levers, and the rewards are the payoffs for hitting the jackpot.\nLike in a slot machine, we need to learn which lever provides us with the highest reward.\nIn the case of the k-armed bandit problem, the state is always the same (or, in other words, it does not matter). We can think about having \\(s=\\overline{s}\\) with \\(\\overline{s}\\) constant.\nIn a k-armed bandit problem, each of the \\(k\\) actions has a value, equal to the expected or mean reward given that that action is selected.\nIn the trivial case, since we know the value of each action, solving the k-armed bandit problem is very easy: it is sufficient to always select the action with the highest value!",

We consider a single action \\(a\\) to simplify the notation.\n\n\nLet \\(R_i(a)\\) the reward received after the \\(i\\)-th selection of the action \\(a\\).\nLet \\(Q_n(a)\\) denote the estimate of its action value after it has been selected \\(n-1\\) times.\n\n\nWe can write:\n\\(Q_n(a) \\doteq \\frac{R_1(a) + R_2(a) + \\dots + R_{n-1}(a)}{n-1}\\)\n\n\n\nTrivial impementation\n\nThe trivial implementation would be to maintain a record of all the rewards and then execute the formula when that value would be needed. However, if this is done, the computational requirements would grow over time. A possible alternative is an incremental implementation.\n\nEfficient computation of estimates\n\n\nIncremental implementation:\n\n\\(Q_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum^n_{i=1} R_i\\)\n\\(\\qquad \\;\\; = \\frac{1}{n} (R_n + \\sum^{n-1}_{i=1} R_i)\\)\n\\(\\qquad \\;\\; = \\frac{1}{n} (R_n + (n-1) \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum^{n-1}_{i=1} R_i)\\)\n\\(\\qquad \\;\\; = \\frac{1}{n} (R_n + (n-1) Q_n)\\)\n\\(\\qquad \\;\\; = \\frac{1}{n} (R_n + n Q_n - Q_n)\\)\n\\(\\qquad \\;\\; = Q_n + \\frac{1}{n} (R_n - Q_n)\\)\n\n\nThis form of update rule is quite common in reinforcement learning.\n\nThe general form is:\n\nNewEstimate \\(\\leftarrow\\) OldEstimate + StepSize (Target – OldEstimate)\n\nwhere the expression (Target – OldEstimate) is usually defined as error in the estimate.\n\n\nTracking a Nonstationary Problem\n\nThe averaging method discussed before is appropriate for stationary bandit problems.\nHowever, many problems are non-stationary. In these cases, it makes sense to give more weight to recent rewards rather than long-past rewards.\nOne of the most popular way of doing this is to use constant step-size parameter (in the example above was \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\)).\n\nThe incremental update rule for updating an average \\(Q_n\\) of the \\(n-1\\) past rewards is modified to be:\n\n\\(Q_{n+1} \\doteq Q_n + \\alpha(R_n - Q_n)\\)\n\nwhere the step-size parameter \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1]\\) is constant.\n\nThis results in \\(Q_{n+1}\\) being a weighted average of past rewards and the initial estimate.\n\nMore formally:\n\n\\(Q_{n+1} \\doteq Q_n + \\alpha (R_n + Q_n)\\)\n\\(\\qquad \\;\\; = (1-\\alpha)^n Q_1 + \\sum^n_{i=1} \\alpha (1-\\alpha)^{(n-i)}R_i\\)\n\n\nThis is called a weighted average since:\n\n\\[(1-\\alpha)^n + \\sum^n_{i=1} \\alpha(1-\\alpha)^{(n-i)} = 1\\]\n\nThe quantity \\(1-\\alpha\\) is less than 1 and the weight given to \\(R_i\\) decreases as the number of rewards increases: actually it’s exponential, and for this reason it is sometimes called exponential-recency-weighted average.",
